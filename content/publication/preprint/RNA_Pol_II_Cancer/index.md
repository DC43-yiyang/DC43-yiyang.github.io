abstract: Hypertranscription is common in human cancers and predicts poor prognosis. However detection of hypertranscription is indirect, relying on accurately quantifying mRNA levels and estimating cell numbers. Previously, we introduced FFPE-CUTAC, a genome-wide method for mapping RNA Polymerase II (RNAPII) in formalin-fixed paraffin-embedded (FFPE) sections. Here we use FFPE-CUTAC to demonstrate genome-wide hypertranscription both in transgene-driven mouse gliomas and in assorted human tumors at active regulatory elements and replication-coupled histone genes with reduced mitochondrial DNA abundance. FFPE-CUTAC identified RNAPII-bound regulatory elements shared among diverse cancers and readily categorized human tumors despite using very small samples and low sequencing depths. Remarkably, RNAPII FFPE-CUTAC identified de novo and precisely mapped HER2 amplifications punctuated by likely selective sweeps including genes encoding direct positive regulators of RNAPII itself. Our results demonstrate that FFPE-CUTAC measurements of hypertranscription and classifications of tumors using small sections provides an affordable and sensitive genome-wide strategy for personalized medicine.

# Summary. An optional shortened abstract.
summary: We demonstrate that RNA Polymerase II occupancy at histone genes, measured by FFPE-CUTAC, serves as a powerful predictor of cancer outcomes and enables efficient tumor classification.
