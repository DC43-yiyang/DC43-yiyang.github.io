**External Partner**: Fred Hutchinson Cancer Center

**Overview**: Our project focuses on developing advanced computational methods and statistical tools for analyzing single-cell multi-omics data in immunological and immunotherapeutic research. Through close collaboration with clinical teams, we aim to understand immune cell heterogeneity and improve CAR-T cell therapy outcomes. Our research utilizes cutting-edge technologies including CITE-seq, CUT&RUN, and scCUT&Tag to profile both transcriptomic and epigenomic landscapes of CAR-T cells from patients and healthy donors.

**Motivation**: Immunotherapy, particularly CAR-T cell therapy, has emerged as a revolutionary approach in treating various cancers. However, the complexity of immune cell responses and the heterogeneity of patient outcomes present significant challenges in optimizing these treatments. Our research addresses these challenges through:

1. Development of a computational framework specifically designed for processing and analyzing CAR-T cell therapy CITE-seq data
2. Profiling the epigenomic landscape of CAR-T cells to investigate cell type origins post-manufacturing stimulation
3. Identifying genomic markers associated with therapy efficacy and toxicity from both transcriptomic and epigenomic perspectives

We collaborate with multiple research groups at the Fred Hutchinson Cancer Center, including the [Turtle Lab](https://research.fredhutch.org/turtle/en.html) and [Henikoff Lab](https://research.fredhutch.org/henikoff/en.html), combining expertise in statistics, computational biology, molecular biology, and immunology. This interdisciplinary approach allows us to tackle complex immunological challenges and advance our understanding of immunotherapy responses.

The project's success could lead to improved patient stratification, better prediction of treatment outcomes, and more personalized immunotherapy approaches. Long-term goals include developing robust computational tools that can be widely adopted by the immunotherapy research community and ultimately contribute to more effective cancer treatments.
