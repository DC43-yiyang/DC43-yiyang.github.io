Ye Zheng is an [NIH/NHGRI K99/R00 fellow](https://reporter.nih.gov/search/FF400P9uy0OX2wY98azYyg/project-details/10572539) and a tenure-track Assistant Professor in the [Bioinformatics and Computational Biology Department of the University of Texas MD Anderson Cancer Center](https://www.mdanderson.org/research/departments-labs-institutes/departments-divisions/bioinformatics-and-computational-biology.html). Dr. Zheng received her postdoctoral training at the Fred Hutchinson Cancer Center from both molecular biology and quantitative modeling perspectives mentored by [Dr. Steven Henikoff](https://research.fredhutch.org/henikoff/en.html) and [Dr. Raphael Gottardo](https://scholar.google.com/citations?user=h9E70BEAAAAJ&hl=en). She has also established close collaborations with [Dr. Cameron Turtle](https://research.fredhutch.org/turtle/en.html) and [Dr. Evan Newell](https://research.fredhutch.org/newell/en.html?_gl=1*22rx9b*_ga*ODQ0NDE4ODc2LjE1NzI2Mzk3Mzg.*_ga_CMZTF4L2MS*MTY1ODE4MzExNC4zLjEuMTY1ODE4MzcwNy4w&_ga=2.37524896.1834883733.1658169553-844418876.1572639738&_gac=1.84158059.1654895497.CjwKCAjw14uVBhBEEiwAaufYx33C2qa6-50yzpX_nFjMkBLtXLDOjibsR2KXay8qStxZLfMIlPmFvxoCet8QAvD_BwE) to decipher the CAR-T cell immunotherapy response variations. Before her postdoctoral training, Dr. Zheng received a Ph.D. in Statistics from the University of Wisconsin-Madison under the supervision of [Dr. Sündüz Keleş](https://biostat.wiscweb.wisc.edu/staff/keles-sunduz/) , and her dissertation topics were centered around statistical modelings of three-dimensional chromatin structure (3D genomics) for promoter-enhancer inference.

At MD Anderson Cancer Center, Dr. Zheng leads a quantitative research group dedicated to the statistical modeling and computational pipeline development using bulk and single-cell transcriptomics, proteomics, epigenomics, and 3D genomics data to address biological and clinical challenges. Her wet lab specializes in the epigenomic profiling of the Formalin-Fixed, Paraffin-Embedded (FFPE) samples.

The goal of Dr. Zheng’s research group is to solve biological and clinically important, and methodologically challenging problems by innovating cutting-edge statistical models. The group is actively hiring at all levels, including but not limited to Postdoc, Ph.D., Master students, technician and undergraduate or graduate interns, and open to discussion and collaboration. This highly interdisciplinary group looks forward to being inspired and motivated by the novel and intriguing problems in other disciplines.
